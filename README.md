# Ball Collision Simulator in Python

2D ball collision simulator developed in Python. The goal of the simulator is to visualize and analyze the collisions between balls, taking into account their physical properties such as mass, velocity, and position. The simulation follows the principles of physics, including the conservation of momentum and elasticity of collisions.

## Features

- Simulation of elastic ball collisions.
- Calculation of new velocities after collision based on the conservation of momentum.
- Graphical visualization of the balls and their collisions.

## Requirements
Before running the simulator, ensure that you have Python installed along with the following library:
- `pygame`.
